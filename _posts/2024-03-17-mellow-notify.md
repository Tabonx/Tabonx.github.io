I detest calendars and am very bad at managing my time. What I use is just a basic to-do list that didn't give me the functionality I wanted, which was to have notifications without generating a task. In order to receive basic notifications for events that don't require my immediate attention and can be completed at my convenience, I set up Mellow Notify to do just that.
