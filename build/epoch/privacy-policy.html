      <h2 class="text-3xl mb-2 font-bold">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Welcome to Epoch. This privacy policy outlines how Epoch, developed by
        Pavel Kroupa, handles your information. Epoch is committed to
        maintaining the privacy and security of your data. This policy explains
        what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding
        your information.

      <h2 class="text-3xl mb-2 mt-4 font-bold">Information Collection</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Epoch does not collect any personal information from its users. The app
        functions independently without storing or accessing any user data.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl mb-2 mt-4 font-bold">Payment Handling</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        All payments for our app are processed through Apple StoreKit. Payments
        are managed by Apple via your Apple ID account, and we do not directly
        collect or store your payment information. Any payment data, such as
        purchase history, is handled by Apple, and we only receive the necessary
        transaction information to deliver the purchased content. For details on
        how Apple manages your payment information, please refer to Apple's

      <h2 class="text-3xl mb-2 mt-4 font-bold">Analytics and Crash Reports</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        We collect analytics and crash reports provided by Apple through App
        Store Connect to improve the app's performance and user experience. This
        information is collected, stored, and shared with us anonymously by
        Apple.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Additionally, users can share their app logs with us from within the app
        via email. This data helps us diagnose and resolve any issues more
        effectively.
